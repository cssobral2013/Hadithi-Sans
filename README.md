# Lexend Font Family

## [www.lexend.com](http://www.lexend.com)

Lexend is a variable typeface designed by Bonnie Shaver-Troup and Thomas Jockin in 2018.
Applying the Shaver-Troup Individually Optimal Text Formation Factors, studies have found readers instantaneously improve their reading fluency.

Lexend was expaned to Arabic in January 2020. The Shaver-Troup Formulation was applied to Arabic with advisement from Arabic Typeface Designer, Nadine Chahine.

This font is based on the Quicksand project from Andrew Paglinawan, initiated in 2008.
Quicksand was improved in 2016 by Thomas Jockin for Google Fonts. Thomas modified Quicksand for the specialized task of improving reading fluency in low-proficiency readers (including those with dyslexia.)
